"""Offline, affirmative count of the reference/snippet pairs in KB YAML files.

Issue #7252: ``linkml-reference-validator`` prints ``Total checks: 0`` on every
clean run because the counter it echoes (``total_results``) holds the number of
*issues found*, not the number of checks *performed* -- the plugin only yields a
result when something fails. A passing run is therefore indistinguishable from a
silent no-op, which has already caused at least one misdiagnosis (#7246).

This module is the downstream mitigation: it walks the same evidence pairs the
validator walks and reports an affirmative ``Snippets checked: N/N verified``
line. It is deliberately **advisory and read-only**:

- it never touches the network -- a snippet is checked only against the body
  already cached in ``references_cache/`` (the same bytes the validator used)
- it never changes exit codes; ``linkml-reference-validator`` stays the sole
  authority on pass/fail (``--strict`` exists for direct CLI use only)

Matching semantics are borrowed from the validator itself
(``SupportingTextValidator``: editorial ``[...]`` stripped, ``...`` splitting
into independently-matched parts, Greek letters spelled out, punctuation and
case folded, whitespace collapsed) so the two agree on what "verified" means.
Which brackets count as editorial is read from the same config both tools use
(``literal_bracket_patterns``), and a mismatch that bracket stripping alone
explains says so in its reason rather than reporting a bare "not found" that
reads as a misquote (#8597).

Issue #7450 added a second, deliberately narrow matching pass on top of that,
because a mismatch against the cache is not the same claim as a misquote in the
KB. Two defects live in *our cached text* rather than in the curation:

- **PDF ligatures.** PDF extraction emits ``ﬁ`` (U+FB01) and friends, so the
  cache reads ``amyloid ﬁbrils`` where the snippet reads ``amyloid fibrils``.
  The upstream ``normalize_text`` does not fold these.
- **Stripped inline markup joining words.** Full-text HTML extraction removes
  ``<i>``/``<em>`` without inserting a space, so "within the *ANAPC7* locus"
  caches as ``within theANAPC7locus``.

Both are cache defects that no amount of re-quoting can fix, so a snippet that
matches only after ligature folding and ignoring word boundaries is reported as
verified under :data:`PairOutcome.VERIFIED_RELAXED` -- counted as verified, but
tallied separately so the cache-defect backlog stays visible.

Separately, a snippet quoted from full text that was never cached (the cache
holds only the abstract) is neither a misquote nor a mangled cache but an
*incomplete* one, and is reported as :data:`PairOutcome.ABSTRACT_ONLY` rather
than as a mismatch -- mirroring the note the upstream validator already emits on
the PMID path.

That split is diagnostic, not an exemption. An abstract-only pair is still
**unverified**: nothing was proved about it either way, and roughly 23,000 of the
cached references are abstract-only, so treating the state as automatically
benign would hide far more than the ``skip_prefixes`` gap that prompted #7450.
``--strict`` therefore still fails on it unless ``--allow-abstract-only`` is
passed. Upstream agrees on the substance -- ``SupportingTextValidator`` appends
its "only abstract available" note to a result whose severity stays ``ERROR``.

        Used only to explain a failure (#8597): when a quote matches the cached
        text with these spans restored, nothing is wrong with the quote -- the
        bracket-stripping step is what broke it, and the error should say so
        rather than leave the curator hunting for a paraphrase they never wrote.

        A snippet can carry both kinds of bracket at once -- a genuine curator
        gloss (absent from the source, and correctly stripped) alongside source
        text the config does not yet keep. Restoring only the spans that are
        actually present in the cached text separates the two, so the hint names
        the culprit instead of going silent on the mixed case.
